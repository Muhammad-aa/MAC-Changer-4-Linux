# MAC-Changer-4-Linux
A MAC Address changer for Linux Distros.
A MAC (Media Access Control) Address is a unique, physical address assigned to a device by its manufacturers.
Devices are identified on a Network by their MAC Addresses. So changing yours, can make you anonymous and can  grant you privileged accesss.
They are often found on a device's network interface controller (NIC) card.
Changing MAC address is not limited to only the Linux Operating System. I will be uploading the code for other OSs soon.
Really hope you find this interesting.
